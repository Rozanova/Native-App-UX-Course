_&quot;You can't use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have.&quot;_

_~Maya Angelou_



_&quot;Even design centers are exposed to the complicity of the media, running the risk of failing to reach their original objective: to make a difference between design as intelligent problem solving and styling. After all, it is a question of a renaissance of the tradition of the Good Design Movement... The advocates of Good Design pursued socio-pedagogical objectives, while the life style centers of today pursue exclusively commercial and marketing aims to provide orientation for consumption patterns… &quot;_

_~Gui Bonsiepe. Design and Democracy._




### Course Description and Objectives
This course is designed to teach students how to design user experiences (UX) for native applications for mobile devices while considering what types of digital products can and should be put out into the world as tools for the day-to-day, as speculative art projects, or as forms of resistance to existing systems in place. The course focuses on usability heuristics, research (human-centered design methodologies) and competitive analysis, information architecture, rapid prototyping and usability testing. Students will familiarize themselves with native UI elements in Apple and Android platforms and design for one of the platforms of their choice. They will learn how to present and defend their design decisions. After an introduction to Human-Centered Design, Speculative Design, and Critical Design, students are encouraged to design critically whether for an experimental app that invites viewers to engage in dialogue about pressing social or environmental issues or for an app that is useful in our current daily routines.  


### Things to bring to class:
:notebook: notebook & :pencil: pencil or :pen: pen



### Tools we will use:
Sketch App, a blog (like Tumblr or a blog of your choice), are.na, and Gmail.



### Projects:
Students will design an app that will fit in one of the following categories: 
1. App as civic engagement tool.
2. Speculative app a design/art project to address potential future societal needs.
3. Critical app design as design/art project that critiques existing social and cultural systems. 
4. Your choice, as long as it follows Human-Centered design guidelines.


### Readings:
Optional: 
[Design and Democracy by Gui iepe](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/desi.2006.22.2.27)
[How Things Don't Work by Victor Papanek](https://papanek.org/how-things-dont-work-the-dreamscape-of-victor-papanek/)

### Assessment and grading
Where applicable, all projects will be evaluated according to the following criteria
in equal weight:

#### Research and ideation: 
Whether and how much thought and investigation have been given toward a particular project in order to arrive at a clear and strong concept.

#### Overall design and concept: 
Formal design quality and how well the piece meets the strategic goals of the project.

#### Organization of content: 
Expression of visual hierarchy, clarity of communication.

#### Execution and craft: 
How well the work meets professional standards, in terms of quality of resolution of images, spelling, and placement of correct native UI elements in the layout. 

The degree of improvement in the quality of a student’s work over the course of the
semester may also be considered in the evaluation of a final grade.
Your final grade will be assessed according to the percentages below:
* Homework assignment completion.............50%
* Quality of work: ..........................15%
* Attendance: ...............................10%
* Participation: ............................10%
* Final: ....................................15%


### General Policies including lateness/absence
Students are expected to arrive in class on time and prepared to work for the entire class
period. Although in-class work sessions are an integral component of this course, outside
work on assignments will be required to meet project deadlines. Significant progress
between classes is expected. Projects are due at the beginning of each class.

Candidates are expected to attend every class session of each course in which they are
enrolled and to be on time. A candidate cannot receive credit for a course if absent more
than two times. No distinction is made between excused and unexcused absences. An
instructor may treat lateness as equivalent to absence. Per CCNY policy, an instructor has
the right to drop a candidate from a course for excessive absences. The Registrar will enter
a grade of WU.

Students who are absent are expected to find out from other students about what they
missed in class as well as any assignments due, and make up the work.
Students who are marked as Absent for more than two classes will have their final grades
reduced by one full letter grade for each additional time they are marked Absent. For
example, and A student who is marked as Absent three times will receive a final grade of B,
one who is marked as Absent four times will receive a final grade of C, and so on.
Students who are more than ten minutes late to class will be marked as Late. Students who
are marked as Late five times will receive a one-quarter letter-grade reduction to their final
grades. (For example, a student who would have been given an A as a final grade who is
marked as Late five times will be given a final grade of A-). Students who are marked as Late
more than five times will receive a one-quarter letter-grade reduction for each additional
time they are marked as Late. (For example, that same student would be given a B+ if she
were marked as Late six times, and a B if she were marked as Late seven times). Students
who are marked as Late eight or more times will receive a grade of F for the course.
A break will be designated in each class. Students are asked to refrain from leaving the
classroom at any time other than that designated for the class break, except in cases
of emergency. Students who fail to adhere to this policy repeatedly will be subject to a
reduction in final grade. Students who are more than ten minutes late returning from break
will be marked as Late for the entire class.

Late assignments will be given a one-quarter letter grade reduction for each class they are
late. Missing assignments will be given a grade of F.

Consideration will not be given for failure to produce work due to loss of data. Please back
up your work. If you need information or assistance in setting up a backup system, please
speak to Professor Hamilton.

### Academic Integrity
Academic dishonesty is prohibited in The City University of New York. Penalties for academic
dishonesty include academic sanctions, such as failing or otherwise reduced grades, and/or
disciplinary sanctions, including suspension or expulsion. Cheating is the unauthorized use or
attempted use of material, information, notes, study aids, devices or communication during
an academic exercise. Plagiarism is the act of presenting another person’s ideas, research
or writings as your own. More information is available at http://sps.cuny.edu/acad_policies/
