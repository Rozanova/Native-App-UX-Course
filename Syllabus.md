> “Even design centers are exposed to the complicity of the media, running the risk of failing to reach their original objective: to make a difference between design as intelligent problem solving and styling. After all, it is a question of a renaissance of the tradition of the Good Design Movement... The advocates of Good Design pursued socio-pedagogical objectives, while the life style centers of today pursue exclusively commercial and marketing aims to provide orientation for consumption patterns…”

Projects in user experience and user interface design for mobile. The course focuses on usability heuristics, research (human-centered design methodologies) and competitive analysis, information architecture (site maps), rapid prototyping and usability testing.
